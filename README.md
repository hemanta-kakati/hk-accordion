# Simple Accordion Example Using React Js
Hi, this is an example of creating accordions using react js or any other library
Idea is simple 
    * use states for storing accordions data (useState)
    * make a component that will hold single accordion or question
    * in this component create a boolean state variable which will store the state of opening and closing the accordion
    * for ex if user clicks on any accordion the "isOpen" state will be true else false
    * now use ternary oparator to display accordion info only when "isOpen" === true
